  <div id="p1">Wheat Bier</div>
The best-known and original wheat beer is Hefeweizen. Using wheat as an ingredient in beer was the first exception made to the famous beer purity law, Rheinheitsgebot. That exception was made specifically so the nobility could continue to enjoy this style.
Our Bavarian style of wheat beer is pale and cloudy. It is bottled and served unfiltered so the yeast used during fermentation is still present. This special strain of yeast contributes banana and clove notes to the aroma and flavor of the beer. Enjoy the best bier from Germany.

  <div id="p2">Ice Wine</div>
  Some of the world’s best Icewine is known to come from Canada, specifically Ontario. Production can be vigorous and can only happen in areas with below-freezing weather conditions. To produce Icewine, grapes are left on the vine until a sustained temperature of -8°C or below is reached, at which time they are hand picked. From there, they must be pressed before they thaw. The result is a juice that is high in sugar and acid, and concentrated with rich, delicious flavours. Enjoy the exported Ice wine straight from Canada.

  <div id="p3">Blended Scotch</div>
Scotch whisky, often simply called Scotch, is malt whisky or grain whisky made in Scotland. Scotch whisky must be made in a manner specified by law.
All Scotch whisky was originally made from malted barley. Commercial distilleries began introducing whisky made from wheat and rye in the late 18th century. Scotch whisky is divided into five distinct categories: single malt Scotch whisky, single grain Scotch whisky, blended malt Scotch whisky (formerly called "vatted malt" or "pure malt"), blended grain Scotch whisky, and blended Scotch whisky. Enjoy scotch from Scotland.
